  #In case IngressNginx is enabled in the cluster, Kibana and Elasticsearch services are available in the cluster with specified domain names ingressKibanaDomain and ingressElasticsearchDomain
  #The certificate are generated according to PKI approach chosen in the cluster:
  # - sgadmin_certificates_enabled - for self-signed certificate generated by SG TLS tool
  # - ca_certificates_enabled - for uploading CA certificate and service certificate with it
  # - external_ca_certificates_enabled - for uploading elasticsearch.pem, elasticsearch.key, kibana.pem, kibana.key from ../keys/nodes folder and use them for services
